# projects — Project & Components

> **L2 · a domain.** Part of the [aep-api architecture](../../README.md).

Manage a project's lifecycle and its components, and render the whole pipeline from a single read: the
Stage aggregate (spec/build/deploy/validation), live version, components, deployments, env-config, and
per-component OpenAPI. **The OpenChoreo `Project`/`Component` aggregate roots live in OC; this domain is
their write-authority + the read projection.**

## Structure — flat-root domain
Unlike `delivery` (kernel-root), `projects` is the flat-root-of-services shape `spec`/`organization` use: the
services (`Service`, `ComponentService`, `ConfigService`, `TraitSyncService`, `DeploymentService`) live in the root package
`projects`, so `Deps` sits in the root and `httpapi/` assembles the slices from it. The two merged features
(project + component) had zero symbol collisions, so the domain is one flat package plus its HTTP slices.

| Slice | Ops | Root service |
|---|---|---|
| `projectcrud` | list / create / get / delete project + get-project-status (the Stage aggregate) | `*Service` |
| `componentread` | list-components / get-component | `ComponentService` |
| `componentbuild` | trigger-build / list-builds / build-logs / list-deployments / component-openapi | `ComponentService` |
| `componentconfig` | get / update component env-config | `ConfigService` |
| `projectusage` | list-project-usage (org-wide per-project usage cards, #291) | `*UsageService` — folds spec-turn + coding-execution per-project usage, labels by live projects, orders by stamped cost |

The shared HTTP vocabulary — `RequireSlug`, `RequireComponentSlugs`, `MapProjectError`, `MapComponentError`
and the private `errFromStatus` — lives in the ROOT (`httperrors.go`), because a slice may not import a
sibling (`slice ⊥ sibling`); the slices call the exported root helpers. This is the flat-root analogue of
delivery's kernel: shared behaviour belongs in the root the slices import.

## Ports
| Port | Dir | Peer · contract |
|---|---|---|
| repo/workspace bootstrap · repo-name conflict | needs | `sourcecontrol` — on project create/delete |
| design read · spec-stage snapshot | needs | `spec` — the Stage aggregate's spec column + component OpenAPI source |
| `descriptorWriter` | needs | `spec` — stamps `specs/.agentic-engineer.toml` on create (best-effort; nil is a no-op) |
| build/exec status (`SetStageSources` port) | needs | `delivery` — the build/deploy columns of the Stage aggregate, wired at the root |
| `runAbandoner` (`SetRunAbandoner`) | needs | `delivery` — ends the supervisors of a deleted project's live runs, wired at the root (nil is a no-op) |
| per-project agent usage (`UsageService`) | needs | `delivery` — the agent-usage ledger, keyed by lifetime (`contracts.UsageScope`) |
| OC `Project`/`Component`/`ComponentRelease`/`ReleaseBinding` CRUD | needs | `openchoreo` client — OC is the store |
| `Service` · `ComponentService` · `ConfigService` | offers | the edge (the 14 public ops) |
| `DeploymentService` | offers | `delivery/run` — project-wide release creation, development binding pin, activation, and deploy observers |

## Owns
- The OC `Project`/`Component` aggregate roots (OC is the store) and explicit
  `ComponentRelease`/`ReleaseBinding` deploy write-authority; the
  `ComponentConfig` env-var rows.
- **Persistence**: the `component_config` gorm and its entities live in this domain (`repository_config.go`
  over `component_config.go`), single write-authority.

## Invariants — don't break
- **Everything after the OC project + repo is best-effort.** Skills provisioning, the webhook, and the
  project descriptor are each logged-and-continued on failure: none of them may destroy a creation the
  user already committed to. The one exception stays the repo-NAME conflict, which can never succeed on
  retry and so compensates the project away and fails. A missing descriptor costs the user one question
  from the `/start` skill, nothing more.
- **Slug guards run before any service touch.** projectName/componentName/buildName path params are validated
  as DNS-label slugs (`RequireSlug`) and 400 on malformed BEFORE the OC client / repo is reached.
- **The wire quirks the contract-first cutover pinned stay pinned**: get-component-config returns a literal
  JSON `null` 200 when no row exists (not `{}`); get-component-openapi returns 409 *with* the componentType
  body for a non-service component; build-logs 503s when the observability client is unwired.
- **The Stage aggregate is one cheap poll (5s active / 30s idle), strict-join.** get-project-status runs
  three sources concurrently — spec from a fetch-free local-mirror snapshot, build from the newest
  `milestone_runs` row (a version's delivery IS its run), deploy from the project's `development` release
  bindings — with no GitHub API, Temporal query, or origin fetch. Any source failure fails the whole read
  (the console keeps last-good); the one carve-out: a deploy tag missing from the local mirror degrades to
  a 0 denominator, not a 500.
- **Build success does not deploy.** Components are created with `autoDeploy: false`. After every
  component build in a milestone is green, the run derives dependency readiness from the current design:
  platform resources retry until Ready; external dependencies park the run with their names until values
  are saved. Only then does one retried deploy activity select or generate each component's newest release,
  pin the development `ReleaseBinding` Active, and run the access-grant, SPA runtime-config, and managed-API
  trait observers. Trait convergence is fatal to that retry unit; the other idempotent observers are
  best-effort.
- **The build stage carries NO task counts** — not zeroed ones, none at all. Their only honest source is
  the version's milestone on GitHub, and a 5s poll may not spend GitHub rate, so the field is absent from
  the contract rather than present and always zero; the console renders counts from the list-tasks
  response it already holds, on the surface that already pays for it.
- **A validation failure is attributed to validation, not the build.** A run whose terminal reason is
  `validation-failed` reports the Build stage `succeeded` and the failure rides `deploy.validation =
  failed`: every coding cycle landed. The carve-out keys on the run's own terminal reason, which names
  exactly one failure class, so no tally or recency heuristic is needed. Every other terminal reason keeps
  the Build card as the catch-all. `deploy.validation` itself is the run row's VERDICT column; the report
  and the per-cycle detail behind it live on the version's run story (list-build-runs).
- **A project delete takes its run SUPERVISORS down before its run ROWS.** Purging the rows does not stop
  the workflows that write them: nothing else ends a run workflow, its milestone poll retries unbounded
  against a repository the same delete removes, and its id is keyed on (org, project, milestone) alone —
  so a project later created under the same name collides with the survivor and its first run is refused
  as already-started, leaving it unsupervised. Order is therefore abandon → repo → rows, and every step is
  best-effort because the OC delete upstream has already been committed.
- **Deleting a project does not delete what it cost.** The delete purges its runs and cycles; delivery's
  `agent_usage_ledger` is retired, not purged, so Settings → Usage keeps the greyed card the page was
  always designed to show. A slug deleted and recreated therefore renders TWO cards — the live project
  billed only for its own work, and the incarnation that spent the rest — because a slug is not an
  identity. Spec-turn spend carries no lifetime marker and sits whole on whichever card is current.
- Platform-wide rules (tenant gate, secrets fence, feature-free domains) → [../../README.md](../../README.md).
